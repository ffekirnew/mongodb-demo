# MongoDB Demonstration

## Requirements

To run the code in this repo. You must have `Node` installed on your system.

## How to Use

First run package install. It will install `mongoose`, that will be our driver to connect wo the actual MongoDB database.

```bash
npm i
```

Once the dependency is installed, you can then take a look at the `index.js`. It will include 3 parts.

1. Connecting to the DB using mongoose
2. Creating a schema.
3. Demonstrating CRUD

To see how it does and inspect the console logs, run:

```bash
node index.js
```
